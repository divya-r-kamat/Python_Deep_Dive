In this project, we are basically testing the continuous integration concept using github actions and pytest.

We have defined a script to add two numbers and we also have a test script which comprises of various test cases to test the functionality.

when we push the code the workflow is triggered which tests the scripts and the workflow results can be viewed under Actions within github
